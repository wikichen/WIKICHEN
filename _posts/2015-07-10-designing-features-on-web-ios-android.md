As the only designer in the company, sometimes I wear too many hats. But one of the most rewarding parts of being able to touch everything is that often the impact covers a lot of breadth.

The following shows a snippet of how a feature release might unfold starting from web / mobile web / email to iOS and Android.

Feature development typically starts on the web given a lot of the backend work usually takes place in conjunction with the web frontend.

The ability to create alerts for apartments has been on the product feature list for a while. The idea is to have a place for people to come back to when we find new apartments for them, or to let them subscribe to an email digest.

I coded the email template for those alert emails; they now contribute to almost half the lead volume as a referrer.

Of course, you should be able to create alerts from the mobile website as well.

We then move on to Android, where development is usually slightly faster in terms of reaching feature parity with web. Here we take advantage of the mobile experience by allowing users to pan and zoom to the areas in which they would like alerts or tap on predrawn neighborhoods.

You can see that the experience translates well onto iOS. The transition to native mobile apps is relatively smooth given it's easier to design for both platforms simultaneously when you have a good feel for the general flow and scope, not to mention the technical foundation, that are already defined on the web.
