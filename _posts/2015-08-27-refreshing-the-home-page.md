This is one of the few purely visual pieces of work I undertook in my time at Zumper, and a pretty substantial one given very little attention or love has been given to the home page since the inception of the site.

After immersing myself in the product and understanding how people use our service, I started the project with a very solid concept in mind. The page would be simple and direct in its message, with nice photography framing our tagline "Make Your Move" while presenting an opportunity to highlight our key product differentiator: the ability to apply to apartments directly from the site with one universal application.

The result is designed and, where photography is used, art directed by me, and something I'm pretty proud to showcase being a fervent amateur photographer.
