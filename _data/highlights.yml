  caption: "I had owned Akira---a 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250R---for over a month, but she broke down shortly after she was delivered from the dealership. I remember this day like yesterday, because it was on this day that she was ready for pickup. With the trepidation and fear befitting any rider's first time, I picked her up from the shop and rode to work. She's been riding like a dream ever since.\n (Rest in peace, Akira.)"

  caption: "Jessie and I enjoyed a lazy Valentine's morning at home, after which we made our way to Dogpatch to find that one particular wall she was so fond of. We took a few photos there after a short stop at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous and strolled around the neighborhood waiting for Serpentine to open for diner. We managed to get dinner service at the bar without reservations --  how's that for dinner hacking?"
