# My Princess Is In Another Castle

My first serious relationship ended today, but rather than the typical sinking sadness, I feel a renewed sense of purpose.

I spent the last six months in a long distance relationship with the most amazing, incredible girl. She was my World 1-1, and every moment spent collecting coins, hitting blocks, and stomping Goombas with her was an unforgettable snapshot in the scrapbook of my life. She opened my eyes to greener pasturers less pixelated, across chasms seemingly insurmountable by a running jump, and most of all, taught me how to nurture a flower into a fireball-spitting instrument of blissful destruction. She helped me realize that it's possible to fly (see: Tanooki Suit) even if your movements are defined by a jump and an action button, and that it's okay to venture off-screen in search of new experiences (see: Negative World) even if the results are disastrous.

It's sad to let something so familiar and so precious go, and even sadder to see that we have reached the flagpole, beyond which resides an empty castle devoid of light and any sign of my princess. Now it's time to move on, to travel down that dark, damp green pipe again towards the unknown, but I'll always remember my time in World 1-1, in what would surely become the precedent of other levels to traverse in the future.

Maybe, just maybe, my princess is in another castle.
