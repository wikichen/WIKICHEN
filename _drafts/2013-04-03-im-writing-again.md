I have exactly two regrets in my life (granted it's only been twenty-one years, but that's beside the point). The first was that I went to Carnegie Mellon, and the second was that I stopped writing.

Writing used to be something I did not because I had to or even developed a passion for, but because to do otherwise and not write made as much sense as stopping to breathe. Writing was as much a part of my life as eating or sleeping was.

I wrote for as long as I've remembered. In elementary school I wrote alternate endings to the Chinese novel of the [Monkey King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong). They weren't particularly good (as they all somehow ended with the monkey's untimely demise), but at a relatively young age I discovered how wonderful writing could be, and my relationship with the written word has since shaped a large part of who I am.

Writing showed me the world. When I was studying abroad in England I met a French girl named Amelia. We spent most of our short-lived time together teasing each other, she about my broken English and I her thick French accent. When we couldn't see each other we wrote&mdash;notes and letters that revealed how different we were yet brought us even closer together. I opened up my life to her, and in return she showed me the world I never knew existed. There was an innonence about it all that, to this day, defines my outlook on the fleeting nature of romance and human connection.

Writing taught me how to love. Most of my exes fell for me because I was good with words (and not much else, really). In a sense writing taught me the value of communication in a relationship. It showed me how to care for someone&mdash;not a special occasion went by without a vomit-inducing written proclamation of love spanning chapters and its own table of contents. Perhaps more importantly, it taught me that even words can't fix misaligned goals and unrealistic expectations. It's probably the most significant lesson anyone can learn in their adolescence: how to move on.

Writing gave me confidence. It meant that I could churn out quality papers like Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore conjures magic spells. It placed me above my peers on job and college applications. I wrote my way through high school&mdash;on personal blogs, on video game forums, on fan-fiction, on novels of my own creation. Writing taught my how to think and to communicate; it gave me a means to explore my own identity in the world despite being an introvert. Through writing, the world made sense to me.

Then I went to college, and amongst the dirty pile of priorities and coursework, writing was buried and never found again. Life consumed me, and I was miserable.

I regreted going to Carnegie Mellon for more reasons than simply that I lost my ability to write (read: it's a topic for another post), but having stopped writing is one regret I can actually fix. Writing made me made a better, more caring, more confident person; I was happiest when I wrote. So here goes nothing&mdash;I'm writing again.
