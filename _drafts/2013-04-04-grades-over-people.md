A lot of people share the sentiment that college was the best years of their lives. Sadly, I couldn't say the same about my experience. I realize by committing myself to writing everyday the path of least resistance dictates I'm going to write about the immediate thoughts that plague my consciousness, which inevitably means I'll want to explore at length on how my unpleasant time at Carnegie Mellon has destroyed and come to redefine everything I thought I knew and loved.

This would be a story in bits and pieces, because to present it as a longform rant would be to do it an injustice&mdash;after all, my three years there were sporadic and chaotic, so it's only fitting my account stays true to the journey it chronicles. It's in my hope that this rather candid retrospective would serve as much to inform my readers as it does to explain why I harbor such deep-rooted personal feelings of angst against the institution. (Whether it's due to legitimate reasons or personal grievances is to be seen.)

<q>Nobody wants to help with booth, because everyone is busy with work.</q>

My friend Dev was catching me up on how the fraternity is doing. It was the same story from before I graduated. Organizations at CMU build these giant wooden structures, or booths, for the Spring Carnival held every year on campus in April. My fraternity, being the new kid on the block, had a small number of people to work with, so we needed everyone there if we wanted to finish the booth in time. We were lucky if we got four people to show up&mdash;most people had the same excuse: we have too much work to do.

This pattern of absenteeism was pervasive to everything we did as a group, but it was also understandable&mdash;perhaps under the guise of being what passed as the norm, as something acceptable and matter of fact among the student population at CMU&mdash;that grades trump all else, other commitments or opportunities or aspects of college life be damned. For the first two years there I bought into that culture, because I thought that was what being at a prestigious university meant and that was what everyone else did. And I wondered why I was so miserable all the time.

When I graduated, I wrote and designed a 12-page alumni newsletter for my fraternity meant to directly address and advise my brothers. It was an impassioned plea for them to stop from time to time and smell the roses. I wish I cared less about academics and more about the people who surrounded me. I wish I participated in more activities, dated more people, changed majors, took more design courses, or simply indulged in the ultimate sandbox that was college. My favorite semester at CMU and the only one I really remembered with any fondness was in junior year where I became an RA, attended parties every week, founded a fraternity, and took eight classes, most of which had nothing to do with my major.

Your grades are insignificant in the grand scheme of your life. Having experienced the <q>real world</q>, I can attest to the fact that your grades carry little weight over the actual competence you show, especially when you're a STEM major. Please, for the sake of that $60,000 per year tuition, do what you love and build meaningful relationships while you can, because you'll come to find out later that life really is about who you know and the experiences that accompany them.

Don't make the same mistake I did. Pick people over grades.
