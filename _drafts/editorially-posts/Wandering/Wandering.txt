# Prologue 

"I'm wandering. Soul-searching, I guess."

I'll never forget her reaction [^helen]. Her eyes lit with such brilliant curiosity as her head nodded with enthusiasm. I could tell she was genuine in her approval.

[^helen]: Her name was **Helen Wang**, and she's one of the loveliest people you'll ever meet. She possesses an infectious personality, the kind that turns gloom into an optimistic outlook for the future, the kind that makes you feel everything is going to be okay. When I was running Delta Upsilon as its founding president, she was the one who helped me through the stress and the burnout. She works in student life and her passion for her job shows, which meant that at times her love for Carnegie Mellon made me feel guilty about my own lack of good feelings about the school. 

It was the first time someone seemed not to only merely understand but truly appreciate what I (didn't) plan to do after graduation. Everyone there had one, a plan set in stone and security long drawn before the fateful day they're handed their cords and paper trophies and banished to the real world, expected to go about their lives like it's a natural progression. 

In the days leading up to my graduation, there was but only one question people dangled about their mouths with a sickening level of fervor. 

"Who are you working for?" 

To say I was uncomfortable would be an understatement. I seethed. I hated each and every encounter, every confrontation with the expectation that employment was the only option, that somehow graduation marked the deadline to determining your future. 

But her response caught me by surprise. She offered an encouraging smile where a wide-eyed, pitiful stare was the usual reaction, as if they saw imminent signs of my slow descent into madness and would rather pass on being the bearer of my misfortunes out of some convenient kindness. (Fun fact: Jared Cohon gave me the same reaction when I met him at the Silicon Valley campus. &lt;&lt; make this into a footnote/sidenote?) 

"That's so great. I don't think enough people take the time to wander in life. Please keep me updated on your progress! I want to hear all about it." 

I promised her I would keep her posted and, without so much a forethought, embarked on my journey to wander with no end in sight. It took a year and five cities before I would arrive and find what I was looking for.

# Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was my purgatory. 

There's something foreboding about the grey, desolate skyline overlooking what is mostly the vestiges of an industrial America, where underneath a poorly applied foundation her pothole-ridden roads reveal desperate attempts at reclaiming even just a quarter of her former beauty as the crowned Steel City. I should have heeded my intuition, because Pittsburgh is one ugly swan.

Nestled in the amalgamation of what can only be conceived in the deranged mind of a psychotic urban planner, where railroads and bridges obeyed no sensible grids and where a recovering urban industrial landscape haunted by failed gentrification married a schizophrenic suburbia with boundary issues, is Carnegie Mellon University, my wonderfully dysfunctional home for three years. 

In an answer to the question ["Why would someone choose Carnegie Mellon over Harvard?"](http://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-choose-Carnegie-Mellon-over-Harvard) fellow alumnus Yishan Wong describes CMU as "Pittsburgh's last steel factory." It's a hauntingly beautiful line that captures the essence of my experience there (and perhaps that of others as well given how many upvotes it's received). 

It took a while before I came to terms with my unhappiness at CMU. There wasn't a specific moment that marked the breaking point. It was a series of isolated incidents slowly building up to the moment when I realized I was more miserable than I've ever been in my life: a fellow student's suicide on the Wean stairs in my first semester, the all-nighters spent in front of the monitor on assignments I couldn't care less about, the difficulty of making close friends who prioritized relationships over grades, and the constant state of denial that pushed me to ignore all the warning signs of burnout. 

To sum it up more eloquently, my time at CMU was to my life what Inferno was to Dante's Divine Comedy, and Pittsburgh my Purgatorio. The discontent provided a compass with which to orient myself toward a better path, a path that has been long lost to me as I struggled to find meaning and happiness in life.

# Pittsburgh was a significant chapter of my life in three ways. 

**I became a people person.** I made very few friends at CMU and made time for even fewer. I worked under the delusion that grades mattered more than relationships and my happiness suffered. In the year I spent wandering I started to make my friendships a priority, and I now benefit from a supportive network of friends from all over the world I can always count on. 

**Location matters more than people think.** Pittsburgh didn't leave the best of impressions when I first visited the CMU campus, but I dismissed the thought thinking I was there for the education and not for the setting. Pittsburgh is one of the worst places for young college students: the bipolar weather patterns combined with some of the worst food options in the western hemisphere made for an abysmal quality of life. 

**Design is my passion.** In my last year I decided to take a break from computer science and enroll in courses outside of my major. Most of them ended up being design or human-computer interaction courses, and it was the best decision I made in college. Funnily enough, the realization came a little too late and made job finding very difficult, but design reinvigorated my love for learning and even for coding. I might have graduated with a CS degree, but I left CMU a designer.

# San Francisco offered me a place—a sense of belonging and of home. 

It was where I fell in love with the world—the summer prior I had worked an internship that exposed me to the city's wonderful sights and culture and people, and it was then I decided I would always call San Francisco home. 

Mere weeks after my graduation, I decided to move to the city by the bay without a job or a network or any substantial savings. Through a series of serendipity, I found a place to stay, a live/work space for entrepreneurs called StartupHouse. In the half of a year I stayed there I met some of the most incredible people: startup founders in prestigious incubators iterating on their products, interns working for the myriad of ventures in the area, international entrepreneurs trying to break into the Silicon Valley tech scene, and hackers &amp; designers toiling away on projects they're passionate about. 

It was the palpable energy in everything around me that won my heart—you could feel the progress and the excitement for the future in everywhere you look and from everyone you meet. I felt welcomed in San Francisco, because it is a place where people are encouraged to define success on their own terms. Wandering and starting something went hand in hand; people didn't look at me funny when I told them I have no idea what I'm doing with my life yet. 

I made some of my best friends in San Francisco, and my friendships have been the pillar of my happiness and an invaluable comfort at times when I'm doubting the road I'm taking. Since many of them only stayed in the Bay Area for the summer and I still didn't know what I wanted to do, I decided to visit them when winter came along. The journey went on.

# I learned how to be **relentlessly resourceful** in San Francisco. 

I managed to live in the city for free for the half of year I was there while earning an income doing bare minimum work. (It's also the hack I put down on my Y Combinator application, but more on that later in the Chapel Hill section.) 

In a brilliant act of resourcefulness (or rather because I was fast running out of savings), I created a revenue stream for myself by flipping apartments on Airbnb and outsourcing their management. The passive income (to the tune of almost $40k by the time I left San Francisco) freed me to pursue my passions in startups, design, and craft beer.

# Boston helped me realize the importance of having the right people around you. 

Ashley, one of the best friends I made over that summer, was kind enough to host me for the two weeks I was there. In touring Boston and being exposed to the culture, one thing stood out to me: Boston is unkind to people like me who take risks and great leaps of faith. 

Having worked at the Bay Area HUB, a social impact co-working space and accelerator, Ashley was motivated to pursue her own venture in Boston—an affordable housing initiative for the local startup community that sought to address the problem of skyrocketing housing prices in Boston. The catch? It's on a ship. The idea sounded crazy enough to work, and it was solving a genuine problem. It was something Silicon Valley would definitely eat up (see: [Blueseed](http://blueseed.co/)). 

So Ashley did all the legwork: she tracked down a retired cruise ship looking for a buyer, she talked to the captain of Queen Mary in Long Beach for an example of how docking a ship to a city could boost the local economy, she reached out to local organizations to garner interest, and she worked her way through relevant government entities for political support. It turned out that people in Boston liked the idea, but nobody wanted to put their money where their mouth is. In the face of the ever deteriorating housing market, when presented with a promising solution that could change everything, Boston showed her true colors: a city mired in the past and in old money, plagued by a myopic reluctance to embrace risk and failure. 

Silicon Valley works as an innovation hub because it's a place where people aren't afraid to take risks, and other people are crazy enough to invest in them despite a high possibility of failure. Boston showed me that having the right people is just as important as being in the right place (and that the two are more intertwined than one might think). Ashley, having come to terms with the realities of Boston, is returning to the Bay Area and giving her venture another shot there. 

I left Boston with a renewed sense of appreciation for the Bay and her people.

I learned the importance of play - or the role that fun would play in my life.

# Side about Alex Poon? 

Alex Poon is one of the most interesting people I've met in my travels. We got acquainted while we were both living out of StartupHouse. After a few months of apartment hunting together to no avail, our friendly was sealed under mutual resentment of the broken housing market. 

Hailing from Queens, Alex was eager to show me around on the weekend we were both in the city, and it was a night in Koreatown to be remembered.
