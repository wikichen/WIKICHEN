    people you'll ever meet. She possesses an infectious personality, the kind that
    turns gloom into an optimistic outlook for the future, the kind that makes you
    feel everything is going to be okay. When I was running Delta Upsilon as its founding
    president, she was the one who helped me through the stress and the burnout. She
    works in student life and her passion for her job shows, which meant that at times
    her love for Carnegie Mellon made me feel guilty about my own lack of good feelings
    about the school. \n"
