# My Interview With Microsoft

I had my first technical interview last week with Microsoft. Not to anyone's surprise, I bombed it miserably. The thing about keeping your expectations low is that you barely take away any disappointment from the experience. What genuinely surprised me was how helpful my interviewer was in helping me set up expectations for myself and future employers. In that aspect, maybe the interview wasn't a total loss.

## Meeting Jimbo

I had waited in the designated interview area at the Career Center in the basement of the University Center before being called and approached by Jimbo. He was a Caucasian man of medium build, seemingly in his 30s, friendly yet stern at first impression. As he led me into one of the small interview rooms, he asked me if I was nervous. Yes, I replied, my hands are sweating all over the place.

Standard interview conventions followed; I was asked for the reason I applied, my interests with the company, my academic standing at CMU, among other things. He pointed out that my interest in mobile development, Bing, and the Xbox division of Microsoft matched their current intern needs. Things looked promising, but they certainly didn't turn out that way.

## The Windows Phone 7 Debacle

In order to gauge my interest in Microsoft products, Jimbo asked me to pick a product that I listed on my application form. I picked the recently released Windows Phone 7. He then proceeded to ask me, "If you could add one feature to the Windows Phone 8, what would it be?"

I was actually caught unprepared. I didn't know much about the Windows Phone 7 and had only jotted it down on my application because it seemed like a novelty which would be fun to work on.

"Think of it this way. Someone thought to jam an mp3 player into a phone, and it all made sense! Someone said, we have GPS technology and we have phones, why don't we combine them? And bam, it all makes sense! So what would you add to the Windows Phone 8 that the iPhone or Android or Windows Phone 7 doesn't have?"

Good question, but I had no answer. I wondered if it was because I was nervous or I was that incompetent in coming up with ideas. No, I always come up with ideas, it can't be that, can it? I suggested TV. Nope, it's been done, try again. I stuttered, my thoughts were in utter chaos, the lightbulb in my head shorted. I stared at his MacBook Pro.

"I see you're staring at my MacBook. Now why would a Microsoft employee use a MacBook Pro and browse the web on Google Chrome? I'll tell you. My job is to beat these guys. If I don't use their products, how would I know what's out there to learn from?"

Good point, but that didn't help me come up with ideas. After some time, he laid the topic to rest. I thought things couldn't get worse, but then Jimbo pulled out the change making problem, and all hell broke loose.

## The Change Making Problem

His specific instructions were this: write a function that takes a number of U.S. cents as argument and return the least number of coins in U.S. denominations needed to match the amount. For example, if we pass in 37 to the function, it should return 4 (1 quarter, 1 dime, and 2 pennies).

I've seen this problem, I thought, this problem has a dynamic programming solution, because you can break the change making process into optimal subproblems. I explained my logic to Jimbo and picked up a marker to write on the small whiteboard adjacent to the desk at which we were sitting. My mind suddenly went blank; at that moment I realized I couldn't code on the spot. I see the substructure of the problem, the for loop, the recursive nature of the DP solution, but I couldn't put any of it on the board that would in any shape or form resemble a working function.

## The Aftermath

Needless to say, I didn't do score too well as a candidate for a Software Development Engineer. We moved on to how one would potentially break this function (I assume he was evaluating me for the alternative tester position), and I replied with some adequate answers, but at that point I knew I already blew my chances.

As the interview winded down to its last minutes, the conversation turned to some rather interesting topics that were what I believed to be a front for pity condolences. But it was a very encouraging display of sympathy. Some of his advice really made an impression on me, so I thought I'd share what I took away from our conversation.

## Jimbo's Sage Advice

 * knowledge is useless if you don't learn to apply it to real problems
 * consider what motivates you, that is, any underlying drive to change the world, when applying for a job, and let it show during the interview
 * always come prepared with product or improvement ideas for a company to its interview
 * put down the most important thing you learned from each employment experience on your resume, because that tells a lot about you as a person
* print your resumes on quality, colored paper to differentiate yourself

We were running overtime, so we shook hands, exchanged thanks, and parted ways. I didn't feel too bad about my botched performance. It was my first technical interview, after all, and there's bound to be more. I learned a lot from my failure that day. Thanks, Jimbo.

Oh, and Jimbo? I'd like a rice cooker built into my Windows Phone 8, because I'm sick of running late to class on an empty stomach everyday.
