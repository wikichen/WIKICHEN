Here's how you play Baseball, a variation of the classic Beer Pong.

* Set up the table like this:

* Each team of four takes turns pitching and batting, just like real baseball.

* The straight line of cups have associated base values: single run for the cup closest to you when you throw, double for the second closest, third for the third, and fourth for a home run.

* When it's your turn to bat, if you sink the first cup, you score one run and the opposing team has to drink one cup; if you hit the second cup, they drink the two cups total (including the first cup), and so forth (so a home run would entail their drinking all the cups and your scoring one point), and vice versa. You always refill the cups.

* The three cups to the left on each side of the table indicate bases. If you're on base (i.e., if you hit the first, second, or third cup on bat and move to the corresponding base), you have the opportunity at any time to steal a base by chugging the cup, placing the cup open side up at the edge of the table, and attempting to flip it bottom side up before the opposing team does the same (that would mean they have someone on the same base as you). If you win, you advance one base. If you lose, that counts as an out.

* The batting rules are slightly more complicated. If you throw the ball and it hits the table first, that counts as an automatic strike. If you throw the ball and it hits a cup but bounces out, that counts as a foul. However, if the other team's catcher catches the ball after it bounces on a cup without landing on the table, it counts as an automatic out. Like baseball, you can foul indefinitely on two strikes, lest the catcher intercepts your foul ball.

* Be prepared to finish the game before the whole nine innings end, because you're going to get very, very drunk.

Tonight we played the whole nine innings and finished three cases of Miller Lite. During the eighth inning we debated refilling the cups with Franzia wine. I also found out that I don't glow as brightly as other Asians do, which is a good thing. Then I cooked Chinese pancakes for everybody.
