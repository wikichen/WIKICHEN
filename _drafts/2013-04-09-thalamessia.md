[![Thalassemia][2]][1]

 [Thalassemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassemia) is a genetic blood disorder describing the reduced amount of hemoglobin produced and the number of red blood cells circulating in your body. This usually means that those who are affected by thalassemia also have some sort of [anemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia), a state in which your red blood cells have a hard time delivering oxygen to your body.

I was born with thalassemia, but I wasn't fully aware of that fact until today. It dawned upon me, as my mom explained in detail for the first time what the doctor told her as I was delivered, just how little I know about my own health.  What led up to this perplexing moment of self-realization was a lab test for a Complete Blood Count (CBC) I ordered online a few weeks ago.

When I received the lab results, I noticed some warning flags. A quick Google query revealed the irregularities usually indicating some type of anemia. It's always occurred to me, perhaps in the form of a nagging suspicion, that the occasional momentary dizziness I felt when overexerting myself could be a symptom of anemia, but as nothing serious followed suit in twenty odd years of existence, I brushed it off like many of my age would. After all, we're too young to be concerned about our health.

But we're not invincible, and often when something goes wrong with our body, it's already too late.

While the confirmation that I have thalassemia will have little direct impact on my daily life, it sure has woken me up to the stark reality of most people's general attitude toward their personal healthcare today. It's because I was one of them, of the uninformed, unequipped mass who have accepted health as an afterthought, it's come to my full attention that maybe, just maybe, something is fundamentally broken about the way we as a society have defined healthcare.

Healthcare should be an ongoing, proactive process, facilitated by a deep, analytical understanding of our own bodies that enables us to make informed, actionable decisions about our health.

This is the problem my cofounders and I are solving with Chekup.
