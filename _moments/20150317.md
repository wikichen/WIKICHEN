I had owned Akira---a 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250R---for over a month, but she broke down shortly after she was delivered from the dealership. I remember this day like yesterday, because it was on this day that she was ready for pickup. With the trepidation and fear befitting any rider's first time, I picked her up from the shop and rode to work. She's been riding like a dream ever since.
