Jessie and I enjoyed a lazy Valentine's morning at home, after which we made our way to Dogpatch to find that one particular wall she was so fond of. We took a few photos there after a short stop at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous and strolled around the neighborhood waiting for Serpentine to open for diner. We managed to get dinner service at the bar without reservations --- how's that for dinner hacking?
