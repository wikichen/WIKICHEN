        <p>Yerdle is a marketplace to give and get things for free, and it was my first real design job. My role at yerdle introduced me to the world of product &amp; interaction design, agile development in a startup environment, and the process of building a product experience that users would come to love.</p>
        <p>I joined yerdle at the same time as another designer named Monica at the beginning of September in 2013. For the next four months we would revamp the yerdle shopping experience on mobile and the web.</p>
        <p>The following case study is a condensed retrospective of my time at yerdle, comprising what I learned and the major projects I undertook. For the purpose of my portfolio, all the assets shown here are cleaned up to represent my own work, though it should be noted that the end results, as with any collaborative process, are a joint effort with Monica and the rest of the team.</p>

          <h2>Solving a discovery problem</h2>
          <p>When I joined yerdle, the product already fully transitioned from a web platform to a mobile-only experience. The idea was that by focusing on a single platform where a tailored shopping experience could be built and iterated on, yerdle would be in a stronger position to expand the online marketplace down the road.</p>
          <p>The iOS app offered a very streamlined, ephemeral experience for browsing free goods being posted to the site, and posting your stuff to gift to other people was as simple as taking a few photos with the camera and fillign out a few fields. It felt like switching to mobile was the right choice.</p>
          <p>However, we quickly found out that our users had a lot of difficulty finding something they wanted amidst the freeflowing stream of gifts that were posted to yerdle. We started exploring ways to enhance discovery by coming up with different methods for organizing and filtering the user content.</p>

        <div class="project__main">
          <p>The brainstorming and ideation phase has alway been my favorite part of the iterative design process. We drew inspiration from existing apps and also let our imaginations run wild. I came up with a myriad of ways that we could organize, sort, and filter items into categories and how we could present this information to the user. Once these potential ideas were sketched out, I jumped into wireframing to get a better sense of how the interface would work.</p>

    <div class="site-wrap">
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="project__main">
          <p>We used these wireframes to create paper prototypes that we then put in front of some users to get their feedback. We learned that the ideas we thought were good turned out to be less than ideal for the average user. They enjoyed being able to see more items in the grid view concept, but didn't find the horizontally scrollable sections to be very intuitive.</p>
          <p>In the end, we took the culmination of our learnings and decided to bring categories front and center to the experience (rather than hidden past a modal that is tucked in the top right corner of the navigation bar). We allocated a tab specifically for rendering a search view that would contain all the categories, so users would have an easy way to drill down and see only the categories they're interested in.</p>
          <p>The process taught me the power of goal-oriented design. By asking the right question&mdash;how do we help users find what they want?&mdash;we were able to anticipate their needs and better visualize the experience from their point of view, while maintaining a narrow scope for what a viable solution could be without teetering into the territory of redesign for redesign's sake. After all, product design is about serving the needs of users, not the product.</p>

          <h2>A branding exercise</h2>
          <p>One of the more interesting projects that Monica and I undertook was a partial rebranding for yerdle in terms of character and direction to which the product would follow. The existing product was long due for an overhaul in terms of visual design, as it was heavily grounded in skeumorphic metaphors that felt antiquated and hackneyed.</p>
          <p>I jumped in by trying to get a better feel of what the company valued and what yerdle represented in the eyes of her users.</p>

        <div class="project__main">
          <p>Yerdle was birthed from the idea that all the unused goods we have laying around our house could be put to good use and given to those who could find them more valuable. It was mission-driven and sought to make a difference not just to her stakeholders but for the benefit of the world at large. As I found answers to the questions I posed to myself on sticky notes, a bigger picture started to emerge.</p>

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="project__main">
            <p>It dawned upon me that the meaning of yerdle wasn't necessarily about the unused goods being exchanged as much as it was about the sense of community and goodwill it has helped to build. Yerdle was about <em>people</em>, and after sketching out a quick mindmap to explore the concept, I had a solid idea of what the rebranding could be.</p>

        <div class="project__main">
          <p>The thesis I presented was simple: yerdle is <em>people</em>. That's what yerdle is all about, that's why separates yerdle from the likes of craigslist. I wanted to leverage people's connection to things, and passing on those good feelings to other people when they receive those things. From that the direction I conceived was based on real life: real exchanges, real things, real moments, real people. For example, the header from the landing page comprises circular nodes of avatars connected to things; what would be cool is if the graph was dynamic to give you a current snapshot of yerdle's heartbeat, showing the transactions taking place at that moment. The branding also extends to the onboarding screens of the app and the email, with a focus on images and photos. Using yerdle is a choice for a positive lifestyle, and the branding should reflect that, that beyond the stuff there are places to go and people for you to meet.</p>
          <p>The feasibility of an image-heavy brand direction was called into question and we moved to a more versastile direction with cartoon characters, but I'm glad I had a chance to undertake this project, to humanize a product and take the creative liberties to really flesh out what it means to impart meaning on a company or brand.</p>

          <h2>The great redesign</h2>
          <p>Three days after I started at yerdle, iOS 7 was unleashed onto Appleâ€™s devices everywhere. The flat, content-first paradigm of the new update was in direct contrast with the existing yerdle app on the App Store. Its branding and design was previously done by a creative studio, and it quickly felt dated as time went on and more apps adopted the flat design.</p>
          <p>The visual transition to iOS 7 was a slow but steady one, and for the majority of my time at yerdle I would be working on getting the mobile app ready for a redesign.</p>

          <div class="project__main">
            <p>My quick dive into iOS 7 design was a crash course in both the intricacies of mobile design and the idiosyncracies of the iOS platform itself. For example, we spent a good deal of time figuring out how and when to ask users for access to their locationâ€”that piece of information is crucial since we depend on the userâ€™s location to help them find gifts nearby. Unlike Android where permissions are asked upfront prior to installation, iOS has an extremely complicated userflow for permissions, especially when the user declines the first request. We never settled on a solution, as the the analytics showed that permissions was not a big enough problem for our users to warrant the engineering effort. That was my first taste of the importance of interaction design.</p>

          <p>In many ways it was much harder to redesign the app from its previous incarnation than from scratch, as the product had grown substantially complicated that putting development on hold for the redesign just wasn't feasible. We spent a few months incrementally introducing updated components to the app: first the navigation and tab bars, then the button styles, then the stream, then updated views for the posting flow.</p>
          <p>To better frame product conversations, I made a comprehensive interaction map for the app's userflow to help plan for new features and diagnose existing user experience problems. It helped to see the entire userflow at a glance, as we can pinpoint specific points of a user process that are particularly bloated or overcomplicated. It's a great diagnostic tool especially for designers.</p>

          <p>Getting a chance to redesign yerdle's mobile app was quite a treat. I got a chance to study great examples of iOS apps and experiment with different techniques for controls and navigation and presentation. The constraints forced upon by iOS paved way to a lot of design learning: the efficient use of space, considerations for touch-based input when it comes to the size of targets, walking the line between iOS guidelines and custom elements, among many others.</p>

          <p>One of the main redesign concepts I worked on was a pullout navigation bar that allowed us to provide the user with more granular options for discovery and customization. The new navigation would allow for a cleaner primary item feed and incorporate a more expansive detail view with a floating custom control for pertinent item info and actions.</p>
          <p>After extensive discussion on the subject, we agreed that the versatility offered by a pullout menu would actually dilute the simplicty that made yerdle a great browsing experience in the first place. Such is the nature of design, and despite my mockups not making it into production, the process of formulating them as solutions was more gratifying than I could ask for.</p>

          <p>Yerdle took a chance on me and brought me onto the team as an unproven designer, gave me the room to discover and grow my design skills and sensibilities, and taught me how to work and function well in a nimble team. Although my time there was short, I'll always be fond of and grateful for the experience.</p>
